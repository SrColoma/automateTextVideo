Shitty experience at an anime convention...
I know nobody is going to care, but I've been to 2 anime conventions, since in the second one something quite unpleasant happened to me, it happens that I was if I'm not mistaken buying some cheap pokemon cards, until I see a cosplayer dressed as if I'm not mistaken Kitagawa Marin hitting a real boy, and you want to know why? Harassment? Something inappropriate? Simply because the boy had Asperger's (which in short is a fairly low autism), I know this because the girl said so, after that if I'm not mistaken the guards arrived and I left the place, that's why I no longer go to anime conventions, I have ASD (also a low autism) and I'm afraid that some girl will treat me like a hole for having ASD, anyway, moral, hitting or making fun of different people does not make you smarter or more "CHAD"...
