Hello, how are you? It's the first time I use this application and just to tell a story to be able to vent I was in love with a girl from first year of high school to third year of high school, this girl was very feminine and a good person had beautiful black eyes and her hair of the same color My God if she was very pretty I met her and talked to her despite not being so close we talked about somewhat private topics and she was like a friend to me throughout that period I saw her from Monday to Friday she had a smile that made me fall in love with her more and more every day but I knew I had no chance I was not very attractive she liked someone else, my friend, you will know how I felt what else could I do, nobody knew that I liked her, on the day of the end of class I was bothering her and she simply yelled at me to leave her alone there my heart broke but I still loved her and so I changed classes, for the following year she was no longer in the same class as me and I only saw her from afar but I still loved her although now she wore glasses, she saw well according to what I that I knew, we didn't talk at all that year only once when I had to ask her something urgently, she answered me in a nice way, and on Christmas and New Years she wrote me and then I wrote her and we started talking all vacation and surprisingly we were in the same room but I didn't talk to her and she didn't talk to me either so after 2 months we talked a little but I realized that she liked someone else and so it got worse and worse, and then when we talked in a group they asked her what her ideal type is and she described my friend and I had already lost hope but I still love her despite everything and listening about her romantic life and how she tried to be with my best friend's ex-boyfriend what nobody suspects of my feelings, after time there is a girl who treats me very well and I feel very good by her side. But I don't know if I still love her or not anymore
