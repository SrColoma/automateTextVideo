I miss my friend I made during the pandemic


This happened to me during the pandemic when we all had to be locked up at home and couldn't leave the house, Facebook groups had become popular and I joined one, it was normal content so to speak, the admin of the group was a pubescent, you could easily tell by his profile picture that it was a legendary free fire weapon, he had made me admin of the group and I joined a girl too, we both stole the group and blocked her and I talked to each other, her name was staryuuki or starmin, she changed her name but she always used the name star and that's what I called her and no, she wasn't the one who makes videos on YouTube as time went by, me and her had become best friends, I always talked to her sometimes we would roleplay in racy chat to the point we would pass each other photos, time passed and she would appear and disappear, she would come and go until we stopped talking sometimes I wonder what happened to her, I admit that sometimes I miss her I know they will say that I sound kind of stupid but I'm sure I'm not the only one who misses a friend who left during the pandemic. So star, wherever you are, I miss you sometimes.
